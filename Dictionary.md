```swift
struct Book: Hashable {
    var isbn: String
    var title: String
    
    func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher) {
        hasher.combine(isbn)
    }
    
    static func == (lhs: Book, rhs: Book) -> Bool {
        return lhs.isbn == rhs.isbn
    }
}

// Now we can use Book as a key in a dictionary
var library: [Book: String] = [:]
let book = Book(isbn: "123-456-789", title: "Swift Programming")
library[book] = "Available"

if let status = library[book] {
    print("The book is \(status).")
}
```

The provided code defines a Book structure that conforms to the **Hashable** protocol, which is used in Swift to allow a type to be used as a dictionary key or as a set element.
```swift
struct Book: Hashable {
```

The hash(into:) function is part of the Hashable protocol, and it's used to hash the object's properties into the provided hasher. 
In this case, only the isbn property is used for hashing because it is unique for every book, which makes it a good candidate for identifying a book object.
```swift
func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher) {
        hasher.combine(isbn)
    }
```

The == operator is overloaded to conform to the Equatable protocol (which Hashable extends), 
allowing the comparison of two Book instances. Two books are considered equal if they have the same isbn
```swift
static func == (lhs: Book, rhs: Book) -> Bool {
        return lhs.isbn == rhs.isbn
    }
```

A dictionary named library is created with Book instances as keys and String values representing the availability status.
```swift
var library: [Book : String] = [:]
```

Creating a default instance of the first book with the key **isbn** of "123-456-789 and the value "Swift Programming"
```swift
let book = Book(isbn: "123-456-789", title: "Swift Programming")
```

The library dictionary is then used to associate the book instance with the string "Available", indicating that this book is available in the library.
```swift
library[book] = "Available"
```

The code checks if there is a status associated with the book in the library dictionary. If there is, it prints "The book is Available."
```swift
if let status = library[book] {
    print("The book is \(status).")
}
```
